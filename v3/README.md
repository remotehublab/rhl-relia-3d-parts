## The third version of cases for ADALM-PLUTO and Red Pitayas
Both are designed using Fusion 360. Both binary and ASCII .stl files are provided, along with the full .f3d project.

### ADALM-PLUTO Case V3
[ASCII STL File](https://github.com/remotehublab/rhl-relia-3d-parts/blob/main/v3/Pluto_Case_V3.10_ascii.stl)

[Binary STL File](https://github.com/remotehublab/rhl-relia-3d-parts/blob/main/v3/Pluto_Case_V3.10_binary.stl)
#### New Features
- The footprint of the case is increased for a fuller look under the camera.
- Various openings on the bottom of the case reduce filament usage and save print time.
- 4-side walls keep ADALM-PLUTOs in place. 1 mm of clearance is included to compensate for round corners or bulging corners due to 3D printer hotend overshooting during high-speed printing.
#### Printing Setting
- Printer Build Volume: 300x300x100 or greater
- Printing Temperature: 215 Celcius (PLA)
- Heat Bed Temperature: 60 Celcius (PLA)
- Layer Height: 0.28 mm (0.4 mm nozzle)
- Print Speed: 120 mm/s
- Walls Count: 3
- Infill Density: >=15%

### Red Pitaya Case V3
[ASCII STL File](https://github.com/remotehublab/rhl-relia-3d-parts/blob/main/v3/Red_Pitaya_Case_V3.4_ascii.stl)

[Binary STL File](https://github.com/remotehublab/rhl-relia-3d-parts/blob/main/v3/Red_Pitaya_Case_V3.4_binary.stl)
#### New Features
- The footprint of the case is decreased for filament saving and making room for a tag holder.
- Red Pitayas are now kept in a better position in the case. Correct clearance is placed between Red Pitayas and side walls to allow elbow Ethernet and USB cables to pass through the openings.
- Four 5 mm steps are included to lift the Red Pitayas on their corners. A Red Pitaya can now be mounted onto the case using 4 M3x4 machine screws.
- The width of cable openings is increased to match that of LabsLand Prism4 plates.
- The number of filament-saving openings is reduced for a better look.
- The number of mounting holes is reduced for a cleaner look.
#### Printing Setting
- Printer Build Volume: 300x300x100 or greater
