## The second version of cases for ADALM-PLUTO and Red Pitayas.
Both are designed using Fusion 360. Both binary and ASCII .stl files are provided, along with the full .f3d project.

### ADALM-PLUTO Case V2 Lite
[Binary STL File](https://github.com/remotehublab/rhl-relia-3d-parts/blob/main/v2/Pluto_Case_V2.8_lite_binary.stl)

[ASCII STL File](https://github.com/remotehublab/rhl-relia-3d-parts/blob/main/v2/Pluto_Case_V2.8_lite_ascii.stl)
#### New Features
- The footprint of the case is decreased to save filament and print time. It is ideal for initial testing.
- The height of the case is reduced to save filament and print time.
- 4-side walls keep ADALM-PLUTOs in place.
- The side walls that keep ADALM-PLUTOs in place are extended to the wall of the case for rigidity.
- TX and RX labels are moved outside of the ADALM-PLUTOs for easier maintenance.
- TX and RX labels' word sizes are increased for better readability.

##### Printing Setting
- Printer Build Volume: 300x300x100 or greater, can be printed on some 256x256x256 printers
- Printing Temperature: 215 Celcius (PLA)
- Heat Bed Temperature: 60 Celcius (PLA)
- Layer Height: 0.28 mm (0.4 mm nozzle)
- Print Speed: 120 mm/s
- Walls Count: 3
- Infill Density: >=15%

### Red Pitaya Case V2
[Binary STL File](https://github.com/remotehublab/rhl-relia-3d-parts/blob/main/v2/Red_Pitaya_Case_V2.5_lite_binary.stl)

[ASCII STL File](https://github.com/remotehublab/rhl-relia-3d-parts/blob/main/v2/Red_Pitaya_Case_V2.5_ascii.stl)
#### New Features
- Red Pitayas are kept in a place in the case because of 4 side walls.
- A Red Pitaya can be mounted onto the case using 4 M3x4 machine screws and 5 mm M3 spacers.
- Various openings on the bottom of the case reduce filament usage and save print time.
